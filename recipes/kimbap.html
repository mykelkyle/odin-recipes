    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kimbap is a Korean dish made from cooked rice and ingredients such as
      vegetables, fish and meats that are rolled in gim—dried sheets of
      seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is often part of a packed meal, or dosirak, to be eaten at
      picnics and outdoor events, and can serve as a light lunch along with
      danmuji yellow pickled radish and kimchi. It is a popular take-out food in
      South Korea and abroad, and is known as a convenient food because of its
      portability.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 oz package of seaweed (nori)</li>
      <li>2 cups white sushi rice</li>
      <li>14 oz package mini cucumbers</li>
      <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
      <li>4 medium carrots</li>
      <li>5 extra large eggs</li>
      <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
      <li>olive oil for sauteing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Bulgogi-Style Beef</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb top sirloin thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped scallions green part only</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp red wine</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1/3 of a kiwi chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the bulgogi beef by marinating the top sirloin with the scallions,
        garlic, red wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and kiwi. The
        reason we add the kiwi is to tenderize the meat. This is a little trick
        that my mom uses for all her red meat. Let it marinate in the fridge for
        2 hours, but no longer, because the kiwi will break down the meat too
        much.
      </li>
      <li>
        On to the rice. I have a ricer cooker, so I cooked the rice in there
        according to the rice cooker’s directions. If you don’t have one, you
        can also cook the rice in a saucepan, just cook it according to the
        directions on the rice package. Let the rice cook while we work on the
        other ingredients, and we’ll come back to it later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cucumber time. Quarter them up and scrape the seeds out with a knife.
        Soak the cucumbers in the rice vinegar, and sprinkle them generously
        with salt on both sides. We are not only seasoning the cucumbers and
        drawing the moisture out, but we will use this liquid to season the rice
        later on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blanch the spinach in salted boiling water for 15-30 seconds or so.
        Drain, and reserve. Spinach is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel and quarter up the carrots, and saute them over medium high heat in
        2 tbsp of olive oil and a sprinkling of salt until they are tender but
        still have some crunch, about 5 minutes. Remove the carrots, and cook
        the marinated beef in the same pan, being careful not to overcook the
        meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a nonstick pan, add 1 tbsp of olive oil, and cook the eggs until it
        firms up into a big egg pancake. Remove the egg pancake from the pan,
        and slice it vertically into long strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly, the avocado. Just cut it up into long strips and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the juices from the cucumber into the rice, and season the rice
        with 1 tbsp sesame oil and salt, to taste. When you have all your
        veggies and beef ready to go, it’s time to make the kim bap! There are
        special bamboo mats that are made for rolling up sushi and kim bap. Lay
        your seaweed out onto the mat, and spread your rice out evenly. Make
        sure not to handle the rice too much or it will get gluey.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smooth over the top of the rice with a spatula, with a gentle hand. Lay
        out all of your ingredients onto the rice, using 2 layers of carrots,
        and 1 for everything else. Make sure to roll it up as tightly as you
        can, then slice with a super sharp serrated knife.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to make inside out kim bap, after you’ve smoothed out the
        rice, flip it over, and put all the ingredients on the seaweed, then
        roll it up and slice.
