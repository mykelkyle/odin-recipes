    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn
      or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded
      around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of
      fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and
      cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety.

      They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa,
      guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion,
      tomatoes, and chiles. Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican
      street food, which have spread around the world.

        apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano,
        garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is
        cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.

      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to
        combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the
        liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove
        from the heat.
