      Thickly sliced cauliflower steaks cook on a baking sheet in an extremely
      hot oven, which allows it to be steamed and browned. This method ensures
      tender cooked cauliflower pieces with a golden crust, for a delightful
      contrast in textures. The simple preparation of this recipe allows
      creativity in flavors and sauces to serve with each steak.
