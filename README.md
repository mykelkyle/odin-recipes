HTML Practice

Recipe blog linking to other webpages.

This was my first project following TOP curriculum. Only using HTML, I created a few small connecting webpages. Some skills I practiced include:

- creating HTML boilerplate
- a href (linking pages | abolute & relative)
- img (src & alt attributes)
- other basic html elements (p, h1-6, unordered and ordered lists)
- git command line (git add, commit, cloning repository)
- mac osx terminal commands (cd, mkdir, touch, ls, mv)
- basic file directory comprehension

Overall, I felt confident completing this project and nothing was overly challenging. However, utilizing git add/commit commands was a little tricky to get the hang of. I think I could improve next time by increasing the frequency and clarity of my commits.

I also had trouble figuring out how to display my images on GitHub Pages. After triple checking the file path and case sensitivity, I realized I had never pushed the image files themselves to the repo. Dumb mistake, but a good lesson to learn for next time.
